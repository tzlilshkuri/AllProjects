button that changes the theme of the application (In out case from bright theme to dark theme). <br />

##### Notifications- <br />
When sendong message for someone the server"push" messages to clients using Notifications Push using Firebase. <br />
That is, as soon as a user sends you a message you will get display an appropriate notification.<br />
(As you can see in the screenshots below).<br />
***A very important note: the notifications can only be seen on devices whose version is not Android 13. <br />

##### Important notes regarding registration and login:
1. The username must be of the form user@gmail.com. <br />
2. When trying to register with a user name that is already in use, we will receive a message that the name is taken. <br />
3. Each password must contain at least 1 capital letter, a number and be at least 7 digits long. <br />
4. When at least one of the fields is empty/not filled in correctly, the user receives a message to check that all the fields are correct. <br />
5. If someone typed different password in the password and confirm password fields he will receive a message.<br />
6. You can't add to your contacts a user who don't exist in the system. <br />
